# Android-Contacts-Code-Test
I wrote this for a job interview I had. I worked really hard to get this done in a week, so it's not the best. The Database functionality works, but it is very inefficient. I will probably clean it up when I have spare time, because it was pretty fun to make.

Here is the link to the apk. I put it on the play store.

Have fun!
